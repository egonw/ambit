 * The MCSS of two compounds is the largest possible substructure that is present in both structures. 
 * The MCS is a measure and a description of the similarity of two structures whose numerical value MCS is the number of common elements provided by the matching conditions, i.e. a measure of the size of the maximum common substructure.
