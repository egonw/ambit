Sources
------

The sources can be obtained from the CICC Subversion repository. To
checkout the sources do

$ svn co https://cicc-grid.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cicc-grid/ciccgrid/smi23d

This will create a directory called 'smi23d', under which you'll find
the source and testing directories

Building
-------

You'll need to install the SCons package (http://www.scons.org/) to
build the programs. After having installed SCons, navigate to 'trunk'
and do

$ scons

The build process will put two executables in 'build' along with their
associated parameter files. Copy these to your preferred locations

Platforms
--------

The codes have been built and tested on Linux (Redhat 64 bit and Ubuntu)
using gcc 4.1.1, Mac OS X 10.4 using gcc 4.0.1
