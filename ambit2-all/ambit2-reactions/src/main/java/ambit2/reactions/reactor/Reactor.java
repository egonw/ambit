{
	/*
	 * Reactor functionality:
	 * 1. Apply a set of reactions to the target in various modes (manage the reaction/ reaction sets to be applied)
	 * 		1b) Apply particular reaction to many targets
	 * 2. Organize various sets of reactions (sort of reaction DB functionality)
	 * 		2b) Organize metabolicc path ways
	 * 		3b) Organize synthetic paths
	 * 3. Search for a specific reaction in particular set of reactions
	 * 4. Filter reactions to be applied on the target (various criteria ...) 
	 * 5. Filter target sites for the reactions: Yes-list, No-list, SMARTS based, property based, ...
	 * 6. Estimate reaction sites (rule based, property based, charges, ...). 
	 *      Here can be used some of the strategy rules for retro- synthesis 
	 *   
	 * 
	 * Application possible functionalities:
	 * - draw/edit reactions
	 * - convert reactions to various formats (io)
	 * - define / edit rules
