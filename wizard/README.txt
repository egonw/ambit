This is a hack to upload wizard.jar into Maven repository.

The wizard site where all credits should go is http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/Database-Client/DBBrowser/com.nexes.wizard.htm

Download wizard.jar and copy into dist folder, then run mvn deploy

TODO: Refactor toxtree not to use this jar
