In the first step of your ToxPredict workflow you are invited to select the structure(s) for which you would like to apply some OpenTox model(s). 
The <b>Search</b> page provide different ways for structure selection:
<ul>
	<li> <b>Search</b>: You can enter any free text, including but not limited to 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS_registry_number" target="_blank">CAS registry number</a>, 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EINECS" target="_blank">EINECS number</a>, 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular_input_line_entry_specification" target="_blank">SMILES</a>, 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchi" target="_blank">InChI</a>, 
		chemical name, or any other keyword; 
		ToxPredict will automatically recognize the intended search type and return zero, one or more hits, depending on the search type, 
		the information currently available in the OpenTox database and the selected preferred number of hits.
	<li> <b>Draw</b>: You can draw a chemical structure in the built-in editor and perform exact structure or substructure search, 
		or structural similarity based search; 
		ToxPredict will return zero, one or more hits, depending on the search type, 
		the information currently available in the OpenTox database and the selected preferred number of hits.
</ul>
