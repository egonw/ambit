In the first step of your ToxPredict workflow you are invited to select the structure(s) for which you would like to apply some OpenTox model(s). 
The  <b>Draw</b> and <b>Upload</b> options below provide different ways for structure selection:
<ul>
	<li> <b>Draw</b>: You can draw a chemical structure in the built-in editor and upload into your workspace.
  <li> <b>Upload</b>: You can upload your own dataset(s); 
  	ToxPredict accepts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_data_file#SDF" target="_blank">SDF</a>, 
  	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_data_file#Molfiles" target="_blank">MOL</a>, 
  	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" target="_blank">CSV</a> 
  	and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework" target="_blank">RDF</a> 
  	input file formats, among many others.
</ul>
Once you have entered your query string, chemical structure drawing or file name for upload, press <b>Upload</b> 
to proceed to the following step of your ToxPredict workflow.
