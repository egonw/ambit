The micro-workflow core lets you define and execute simple workflows. Implementing
the parts of your application that are likely to change as workflows makes your
application easier to change. I haven't had a chance to write any documentation to
accompany this first release. Until I do that, the JUnit test cases are a good place to
start. Drop me a line if you have problems.
