 [RDF] W3C Resource Description Framework

  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework}Resource Description Framework}} (RDF) describes any object as a collection of triples, each consisting of a subject, a predicate and an object. The predicate (also called a property) denotes the relationship. More details (definition, syntax, tutorials) are available at {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/}W3C}} site and elsewhere online.

 (description of the resources)  
 {{{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740341/what-is-the-difference-between-rdf-and-owl}http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740341/what-is-the-difference-between-rdf-and-owl}}
 
 Resources are described in terms of properties and property values using RDF statements.
 Statements are represented as triples, consisting of a subject, predicate and object. [S, P, O]

 [Data model] RDF is a data model, not format

  The data model consists of objects and their relationships. Objects are modeled in RDF as {{Classes}} (<<rdf:Class>>),
  and {{Classes}} have specific {{Instances}}.  Relationships are modeled with {{Properties}} (<<rdf:Property>>).  
	
 [Formats (serialization)]  Once a data model is defined, it could be serialized into different formats:

    * {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/}RDF/XML}}
    
    * {{{http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html}N3}}
    
    * {{{http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/}TURTLE}}
    
    * JSON serialization is being {{{http://json-ld.org/}discussed}} and some implementations are available
