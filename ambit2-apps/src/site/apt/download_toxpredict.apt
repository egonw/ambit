{ToxPredict web application} 

  A prototype web application that accepts chemical structures and identifiers as input and automatically generates a toxicity report based on several remote OpenTox toxicity models.
  Developed by {{{www.ideaconsult.net}Ideaconsult Ltd.}} in the framework of {{{http://opentox.org}OpenTox}} project.
  
  Uses {{{http://apps.ideaconsult.net:8080/ambit2/}AMBIT REST Web services}}, as well as several remote {{{http://opentox.org/dev/apis}OpenTox API}} compliant web services.

	<<Please note>>: You can use {{{http://www.toxpredict.org}ToxPredict}} online, without installing any software locally. 
	The only requirement is a recent Web Browser, supporting JavaScript, and Java enabled, in order to use 
	the structure diagram editor. 
	
	Proceed with the download, only if you would like to install a local version of ToxPredict.   

*Download ToxPredict

	[Web application archive] {{{http://ambit.uni-plovdiv.bg/downloads/ambit2/2.4.1/ToxPredict/ToxPredict.war}ToxPredict.war}}
	
    []
    
*Deployment 
    
	Copy <<ToxPredict.war>> under <webapps> directory of the servlet container. The application should be accessible at
	
+---------------------------------  	
 http://localhost:8080/ToxPredict
+---------------------------------  
    
*{Configuration} 

	ToxPredict depends on {{{./download_ambitrest.html}AMBIT REST services}} and 
	{{{./download_ontologyservice}Ontology service}} installed and properly configured.
	ToxPredict retrieves the list of QSAR models from the preconfigured Ontology service.
	    
    ToxPredict can be configured to work with any combination of these services installed on the same or on a remote machine.

	ToxPredict is configured to expect AMBIT2 services at {{{http://localhost:8080/ambit2}http://localhost:8080/ambit2}} 
	and Ontology service at {{{http://localhost:8080/ontology}http://localhost:8080/ontology}}.
	 
    After deployment to the servlet container, this can be changed by editing the configuration file:
 
+----------------------- 
WEB-INF/classes/config.prop
+-----------------------

 The configuration is essential for ToxPredict functioning properly, as it communicates to ambit2.war and ontology.war via OpenTox API only, 
 and does not use direct connection to the database.
