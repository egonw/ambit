    <<AMBIT Discovery>> is an user-friendly open source application, which estimates <<applicability domain>> of QSAR models 
    by assessing structural similarity to a set of chemicals. It calculates the similarity of a chemical to a set in the 
    following ways. The first approach is based on distances (Euclidean, City block) suitable when similarity 
    is assessed in descriptors space. Several preprocessing data functionalities are available to deal with 
    linearly dependent descriptors (rotation via Principal Component Analysis), centering to remove effects of 
    different numerical values ranges of the descriptors before PCA. 
    
    <<AMBIT Discovery>> provides means to calculate the probability of a chemical belonging to a set represented 
    by non-parametric probability density estimation. To assess structural similarity the user has a choice of 
    Daylight style hashed fingerprints or atom environments (topological neighborhood). Details on similarity methods are provided in
