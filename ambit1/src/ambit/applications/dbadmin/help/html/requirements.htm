                SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS & INSTALLATION

<p>     
    The AMBITDatabase requires Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition
    1.4 or newer on the target system and it is platform-independent. It runs
    under any host operating system, which supports Java(TM) 2 Runtime
    Environment, Standard Edition. The hardware requirements include 1,5 GB
    free disk space and a minimum of 256 MB available RAM (512 MB or more is
    highly recommended).
<p>     
    The AMBITDatabase application is distributed with fully automated offline
    installer (AMBITDatabase-vX.YZ-offline-setup.exe), compatible with recent
    versions of the Microsoft Windows (NT, 2000, XP, 2003) operating system. In
    order to install the AMBITDatabase just run the installer and follow its
    instructions. It contains all the required packages, including the Java(TM)
    2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition 1.4 setup and a standalone MySQL
    database server. The installer will check the size of available free disk
    space on your system and will allow you to install the AMBITDatabase only if
    the above mentioned requirement is met.
<p>     
    If the installer does not detect Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard
    Edition 1.4 or newer on the target system, it will attempt to install it
    before proceeding with the AMBITDatabase setup. In this case, the user
    running the installer SHOULD HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE PRIVILEGES on the target
    system (otherwise the Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition
    setup would be aborted and the AMBITDatabase would not be installed).
<p>     
    If the installer detects Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition
    1.4 or newer already installed on the target system, it will proceed
    directly with the AMBITDatabase setup. In this case, ADMINISTRATIVE
    PRIVILEGES ARE RECOMMENDED BUT NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRED.
<p>     
    When the installer is launched by a user with administrative privileges, it
    will create AMBITDatabase start menu shortcuts for all the users registered
    in the target system. Otherwise, start menu shortcuts will be created only
    for the unprivileged user, who launched the installation.
<p>     
    After a successful installation, the AMBITDatabase could be launched from
    the Start Menu ("Start -> All Programs -> CEFIC-LRI ->AMBITDatabase-vX.YZ ->
    AMBITDatabase-vX.YZ").
<p>     
    Each version of the AMBITDatabase could be uninstalled either by using the
    "Control Panel -> Add or Remove Programs" or by clicking the "Uninstall"
    link located in "Start -> All Programs -> Ideaconsult -> AMBITDatabase-vX.YZ ->
    Uninstall- AMBITDatabase-vX.YZ". Any application files which may happen to be
    locked during the uninstall procedure would be deleted after the next
    reboot of the system. Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition
    would not be uninstalled by the AMBITDatabase uninstaller. If needed, it
    could be uninstalled via its own entry in "Control Panel -> Add or Remove
    Programs".
