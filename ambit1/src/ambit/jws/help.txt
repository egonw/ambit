The arguments Web Start (javaws) uses when kicking off the Java runtime (java) change from version to version. 

To see what your Web Start copy uses under the hood turn on the environment variable JAVAWS_TRACE_NATIVE=1 and fire off Web Start on the command line e.g. javaws.exe http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/apps/notepad.jnlp Web Start will popup a message box that shows you the full command line that you can use to kick off your app for debugging.
