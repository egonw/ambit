web.xml - store/read servlet parameters
use destroy servlet method to close database connection (closing stuff)
One reason for setting up a custom URL for a servlet or JSP page is so that you can
register initialization parameters to be read from the init (servlets) or jspInit
(JSP pages) methods. However, as discussed in Section 5.5 (Initializing and Preloading
Servlets and JSP Pages), the initialization parameters are available only when the
servlet or JSP page is accessed by means of a custom URL pattern or a registered
name, not when it is accessed with the default URL of http://host/webAppPrefix/
servlet/ServletName. Consequently, you might want to turn off the default URL so
that nobody accidentally calls the uninitialized servlet. This process is sometimes
known as disabling the invoker servlet, since most servers have a standard servlet that
is registered with the default servlet URLs and simply invokes the real servlet that
the URL refers to.
There are two main approaches for disabling the default URL:
• Remapping the /servlet/ pattern in each Web application.
• Globally turning off the invoker servlet.

filters - filters can
intercept and modify the request coming into or the response going out of a servlet
or JSP page. Before a servlet or JSP page is executed, the doFilter method of the
first associated filter is executed. When that filter calls doFilter on its Filter-
Chain object, the next filter in the chain is executed. If there is no other filter, the
servlet or JSP page itself is executed. Filters have full access to the incoming
ServletRequest object, so they can check the client’s hostname, look for incoming
cookies, and so forth. To access the output of the servlet or JSP page, a filter can
wrap the response object inside a stand-in object that, for example, accumulates the
output into a buffer.

Web : Online:
I have just 1 small bug for you to-do-list:
for the ENTRY: smiles-string:
     
CNC(=N)c1ccc(cc1)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2)C(=N)Nc3ccc(cc3)C(=N)Nc4ccc(cc4)C(=N)NC
it generates a very long name in one line (without writing it to more 
than 1 line, CR)
therefore the 2D picture ofvthat entry is out of the screen, please 
FORMAT "names of compounds"
> Dear Nina,
> I have just located the compound in question (but there are maybe some 
> others too ??)
> I have used Netscape 7.0:
> STATISTICS
> SSSR
> going to NUMBER of COMPOUND = 141
> Entry No = 15
> Click on the Bruttoformula gives the details (3D structure on the left 
> side on so on)
> If you click on "2D structure" , then the right side of that windows 
> moves (because of the long name of that compound) out of my screen to 
> the right side.
> 
> maybe you can find this entry.
> 
> I have just repeated the some search using Internet Explorer 6.0 and 
> this was fully o.K.
> So it may only happen with the browser: netscape.
> 
> With IE. the compounds name is written over 2 lines
> With Netscape the name is in 1 line (that is the reason);
