<h2>What is JChemPaint?</h2>
<p>
JChemPaint <a href="bibliography.html#KRA00">[KRA00]</a> is an editor for 2D Molecular Structures, 
like this one here   <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../../small-bin/caffeine.gif">. 
JChemPaint is intended to be complementary to JMol(<a href="http://www.openscience.org/jmol">http://www.openscience.org/jmol</a>), 
a visualisation and analysis tool for 3D molecular structures, which is, 
like JChemPaint, developed by an international team of opensource programmers.

<td>In at least three aspects JChemPaint is different from other programs of this sort:
<ol>
<li>
  JChemPaint is an open source program <a href="bibliography.html#OS">[OS]</a>. It is Free Software. </p> 
  <p>We believe that scientific software, especially when its development was 
  publically funded, should be free. As the GNU (<a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org</a>) people put it: Free Software 
  is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should 
  think of 'free speech', not 'free beer.' ".</p> 
  <p>Everyone can participate in the development of the program. Everyone can 
  download and change the source code, provided that he makes the changes 
  publicly available again, according to the GNU General Public License (GPL) 
  or GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), depending on the classes 
  which have been changed. </p>
  This ensures that the community can take advantage of any bugfix/enhancement 
  made to the system.</p>
  <p>It also ensures that a scientist, who needs a standard piece of software 
  like a structure editor as a helper application in her new program, 
  does not have to reinvent the wheel over and over again because all the 
  structure editors that have been written before are now proprietory software. 
  If there is a free structure editor, she can focus on the real science.</p>
<li>JChemPaint is far from being complete :-). Honestly, it need's plenty 
  of development (see below).
<li>Since JChemPaint is written in Java it runs on any computing platform and 
  operating system for which a Java Virtual Machine (of version >= 1.4) has 
  been implemented (like Linux, Windows 95/98/NT/Me/XP, Solaris, AIX and others).
<li>JChemPaint is avaiblable free of charge.

JChemPaint, currently in release 2.0, supports:
<ol>
<li>A subset of the regular drawing features of commercial programs, as there are
    <ol>
      <li type="a">drawing of single, double, triple and stereo bonds
      <li type="a">stereo bonds
      <li type="a">deletion of bonds and atoms
      <li type="a">ring templates (3-8)
      <li type="a">one-click attachment of ring templates to an atom or a bond
      <li type="a">charges
    </ol>

<li>Loading and saving of structures in Chemical Markup Language (CML) 
  <a href="bibliography.html#PMR99">[PMR99]</a>, [ WIL2001 ] and as MDL Molfiles and SDF files (Load only for 
  the latter)<a href="bibliography.html#DAL92">[DAL92]</a>.
<li>Automated Structure Layout, also known as Structure Diagram Generation 
  <a href="bibliography.html#HEL99">[HEL99]</a>, <a href="bibliography.html#BLE91">[BLE91]</a>.
<li>Loading structures from the Internet usign CAS or NSC number
<li>Pasting structures as SMILES strings from the clipboard (not on Linux).
<li>Normalization of structures, currently limited to aromaticity detection.
<li>Rudimentary Carbon NMR chemical shift range prediction based on one-sphere 
  HOSE codes.
<li>Saving bitmap pictures of the structures.
<li>Saving structures as Scalable Vector Graphics ( SVG )
<li>Postscript printing.
